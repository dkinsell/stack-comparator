## Modes

- **None Mode**: This is the default mode where no interactions are enabled. It allows users to view the stacks without making any changes.
- **Add/Remove Mode**: Allows users to add or remove blocks from the stacks. This mode is ideal for setting up the initial configuration of the stacks.
